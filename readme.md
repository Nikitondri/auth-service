# Project README

Welcome to our Spring Boot project! This project consists of three microservices designed to work together seamlessly. Below, you'll find detailed information on each microservice and their functionalities.

## Microservices:

### 1. db-migrations

**Description:** The `db-migrations` microservice is responsible for managing database migrations using Liquibase for MySQL databases.

**Functionality:**
- Handles database schema changes using Liquibase scripts.
- Ensures database schema evolution is managed efficiently and consistently across environments.
- Facilitates versioning and tracking of database changes.

### 2. patient-domain

**Description:** The `patient-domain` microservice serves as a resource OAuth2 server and implements CRUD operations for the `patient` entity. It utilizes JOOQ as the database access layer.

**Functionality:**
- Implements OAuth2 server functionality to secure resources and manage access tokens.
- Provides CRUD operations for managing patient entities.
- Utilizes JOOQ for efficient and type-safe database access.

### 3. gateway-service

**Description:** The `gateway-service` microservice acts as a client OAuth2 server, handling authentication and authorization.

**Functionality:**
- Facilitates user authentication and authorization using OAuth2 protocol.
- Serves as an entry point for clients to access protected resources.
- Manages access tokens and verifies user permissions.

## External Component:

### 4. Keycloak

**Description:** Keycloak is an open-source OAuth2 server used for authentication and authorization.

**Functionality:**
- Provides OAuth2 server capabilities for user authentication and authorization.
- Offers robust security features for managing access to resources.
- Integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot applications for securing APIs and web applications.

## Setup Instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java JDK installed on your system.
3. Configure the necessary environment variables for database connection and OAuth2 settings.
4. Build each microservice using Maven or Gradle.
5. Run each microservice independently, starting with `db-migrations` followed by `patient-domain` and `gateway-service`.
6. Optionally, configure Keycloak as your OAuth2 server and integrate it with `gateway-service` for user authentication and authorization.
